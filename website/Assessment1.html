	<h3> Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW): Explain how the web works, the role of web servers, what are web browsers?
</h3>
	<p>The worldwide web is a system of interlinked documents and pages that can be accessed by the internet. The documents on the world wide web can operate as it is created by HyperText Markup Language Code (HTML) and the information that is coded onto these documents can display audio, images and text if a device is being used. Each document of the world wide web has an online address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A web server runs and distributes web pages by using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The role of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to users. To physically view the world wide web you need a web browser. Web browsers are applications that help you access and view websites. Examples of web browsers are google chrome, Microsoft edge, internet explorer and firefox.
</p>

<h3>How is the world wide web different to the internet?
</h3>
<p>The world wide web by itself is the billions of pages that can be accessed on your devices. But to go onto the world wide web you need to use the internet as it connects your device to millions of other devices as well as these online pages. The internet consists of many interconnected networks. In short, the world wide web is all of the information that is accessible via the internet that connects your device to millions of others. The worldwide web is the information and the internet is what gives people access to that information.</p>

<h3>What is an intranet? How does it relate to the internet?
</h3>
<p>Intranet is another communication network that is similar to the internet. The intranet is a private network that can only be accessed by specific people. The difference between the intranet and the internet is that the internet connects information globally whereas the intranet connects information through a local or restricted network. This helps people share, organize and store information within an organization. An example of an intranet is a messaging system that can only be used by employees working at a specific company.

<h3>What is an internet protocol?  compare HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP
</h3>
<p>Internet protocol is the method that is used to transfer data from one computer to another computer on the internet. Examples of internet protocols are HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP. HTTP or HyperText Transfer Protocol is a protocol that can deliver files and even results about questions. TCP or Transmission Control Protocol is similar to HTTP but uses an IP address instead of a URL like HTTP does. HTTP uses TCP to transfer data. FTP or file transfer protocol transfers files from one person to another whereas HTTP transfers files from a person to a website. FTP also uses TCP to transfer data. FTP is more efficient than other protocols at transferring large files but HTTP is better at transferring smaller files. TCP has a persistent connection with HTTP so HTTP has a better performance.
