				<p>My name is Krushna Pandalaneni and I live in Sydney, Australia. Right now I am 14 years old and I go to Hurlstone Agricultural High School <a href="https://hurlstone-h.schools.nsw.gov.au/">(HAHS)</a>. I am in 9th grade so I currently study maths, English, science, history, geography, agriculture and pdhpe. When I was given the choice to learn about subjects that interest me I chose IST (Internet and Software Technology) and food technology. The subjects are awesome because I enjoy learning about the cool operations I can do on a computer and I also enjoy being able to eat food every once in a while during class. After school, I take a train ride and a short walk back home. At home, I play video games on my laptop and watch shows. I mostly play league of legends and valorant. If Iâ€™m not slacking off then I am studying to try and get an A grade on all my subjects. In the future, I hope to have a job that I enjoy, probably a job that's in the technology field. I am going to use this E-portfolio as a place to showcase my work particularly my IST, food tech and maths work.
